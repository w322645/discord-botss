# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## What is this task schema??? Will I create a schema for every task I give!

The task schema is a system prepared for the 'take task' command. In the `task take` command, I added a schema system to avoid complexity, since the bot gives a random task. When the bot will randomly give a task, it randomly chooses one of the schemes you have determined and gives that task to the person. In addition, you can quickly assign a task by adding a schema directly with `task schema give @user schema-id`. :yum:

## What if I'm going to give everyone one task or is there a shortcut for it?! ü§¨

Of course there is :). If you tag a role instead of a person while giving a task, the bot will automatically distribute their tasks to **authorized** everyone in that role. üòâ

## Now we have `ranks.json` on our heads, what is this?

The "ranks" part in the `ranks.json` file is the part where your privileges are. In short, the ranks section has been moved to a json file so that you can add rank with the command. "tasks" is where the task diagrams are located. If you do not want to add a rank or mission chart with the command, you can write **in accordance with the format** in those parts.

## Well? I downloaded this bot as an authorization booster bot, the coin part is not visible???

There are 3 reasons why the coin section is not visible;

- The person does not have roles that you enter the ID in `staffs` in the `config.json` file.
- You have not added authorization to your bot.
- The coin system is closed.

If it still doesn't appear after checking them, you can write to the help channel on my server.

## What is this sync command?

The synchronize command works as follows; Let's say you entered the 'x, y and z' roles in the 'ranks' section and added the bot to the server. But when you added the bot, I had the 'z' role. If you don't use sync command on me, when I bypass the bot will take my `z` role and give me `x` role. But if you use the synchronize command, the bot will sync my coin count with the coin you assigned to the `z` role.

## I downloaded this bot because there is a task system, invite and registration tasks do not work?? ü§¨ü§¨

In order for the invite tasks to work, you need to download and install my registration bot [here](https://github.com/thearkxd/discord-supervisor-bot) and add it to the server where this bot is located. In order for the registration tasks to work, you need to register the people coming to the server through that bot. :blush:

## I added the bot to my server, I installed it, but the slash commands do not appear?

For Slash commands to appear, you need to grant application commands permission when adding the bot to your server.

- First of all, we enter our bot page from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Then, under the 'OAuth2' tab, we click on 'URL Generator' from the left menu.
- Click on `applications.commands` from the right side and copy the link below.
- After you enter the link and give permission to our bot, your slash commands will appear.
